# TODO
What is there to do:
- resize the plot automatically
- check if the webview can be used to drag something onto
- show some data set info
  - general number of attributes
  - a legend for which axis is what for many dimensions
- Can you use some QObject-JS array thingy instead of JSON strings to pass data? That might be much faster
- Controls
  - Color given by dimension
  - Make axis dragable (instead of brushing, since this does not work well at the same time when there are many axes)
  - Several brush options
